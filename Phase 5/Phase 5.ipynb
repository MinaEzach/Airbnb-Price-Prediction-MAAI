    "A machine learning model is a living asset. The performance of the Random Forest model will automatically degrade with the passing of time as the Barcelona rental market changes. This phase defines the concept of MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) to make sure that the model stays accurate by implementing the automatic auditing and lifecycle management.\n",

    "**Objectives:**\n",
    "1. **Monitoring of performance:** detecting when the model's error (RMSE) drifts.\n",
    "2. **Drift Identification:** differentiating between Data Drift and Concept Drift.\n",
    "3. **Lifecycle Policy:** Determine retraining schedules and model retirement regulations."
